                    This page was designed by <a href="https://hub.stratisdermanoutsos.com/">Stratis</a>.

                    I found his work on <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/1275022676306773824">Figma</a> and found this design easy to follow and the first impression 
                    I had was "this guy is a really good programmer".
                    <br><br>
                    I hope my rendering does his design justice and my audience feels the same way as I did when I saw his work.
                    <br><br>
                    He was kind enough to let me use his design, so I really want to thank him üôè!
