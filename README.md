### To post blogs

Step 1: Convert .odt file to html

Step 2: Compress all .png files into an "images" folder
- compressed .zip file can be called anything it will ultimatly be renamed to "images" in the code.

Step 3: Code snippets 
- compressed .zip file must be called "code_snippets".
- cut out all code snippets in the .html file and place them in their own .html files with the name "codeSnippet##-SomeDescription.html"
- the new "codeSnippet##-SomeDescription.html" should look like:
    ```
    <div class="div_code"><code>    start here
        Some code here... anything
    </code></div>
    ```
    - start code in the top line indented 4 spaces. Otherwise there will be an extra line.
    - OR you could just add a line to the bottom so the spaceing is the same on the top and bottom.
- compress these files into a "code_snippets" folder.
